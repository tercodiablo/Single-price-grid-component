## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action


## My process | Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid areas

### What I learned

My major learning was the responsive design with grid

```css
.grid{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas: "head head"
                        "price info";
    
}

.item1 { 
    grid-area: head;
    /*put here all the attributes for class item1*/
}
```

### Continued development

I want to refine the responsive design and try mobile first path. So I'll be re-doing this challenge on the next days
